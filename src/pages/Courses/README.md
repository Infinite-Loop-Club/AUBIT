## Courses

The main objective of the courses page is to give an idea about the courses offered in BIT Campus. The courses are divided into two categories :
        1) UG Courses
        2) PG Courses
### States

1.[ug, Setug]:
    This state is used to change between the tabs "UG Courses" and "PG Courses". Initially, this state is set true and whenever "PG Courses" tab is clicked, it changes to false. This process happens inverted when we again click on "UG Courses".
